# *Connecting Minds, Machines, and Meaning*

Welcome to my GitHub.

My journey weaves together mathematics, storytelling, and machine learning ‚Äî a path driven by curiosity, built through exploration, and shaped by the desire to make technology more human.

It all started with a deep love for **mathematics**, which laid the foundation for everything I do today. Over time, this evolved into a fascination with how **Artificial Intelligence** can enhance decision-making, augment human abilities, and create meaningful change. Today, I'm exploring the frontiers of **Quantum Computing** and **Data Spaces**, while staying grounded in the power of clear thinking and elegant problem-solving.

I believe that technology becomes powerful when it's understood, shared, and used boldly. That belief has shaped every project I‚Äôve led and every team I‚Äôve worked with. Here‚Äôs a glimpse into that journey:

## üöÄ Projects

### üß† Decoding Thought with Machine Learning
*Project: Brain-Computer Interface with EEG signals (42 Urduliz Bizkaia)*

I trained a machine learning model to interpret brain signals (EEG) and classify imagined motor actions (like hand or foot movement). This project required mathematical precision (PCA, matrix transformations), signal processing, and careful pipeline design using Scikit-learn. It was developed in **Google Colab** to promote reproducibility and collaborative learning.

### ‚ú® LLMs - Transfer Learning in Sentiment Analysis
*Project: NLP Fine-Tuning with Pretrained Models (42 Urduliz Bizkaia)*

This project explored how large language models (BERT, DistilBERT) can be fine-tuned to analyze text sentiment with minimal data and resources. Built in **Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab**, it includes hands-on experimentation with tokenization, hyperparameters, and model generalization.

### üß¨ Neural Networks from Scratch
*Project: Breast Cancer Tumour Detection using ML (42 Urduliz Bizkaia)*

Built from the ground up using **pure Python**, this project implements a fully functional multilayer perceptron to classify breast cancer as benign or malignant. We focused on transparency, performance, and the potential of machine learning to improve real-world decision-making.

### üåå Galaxy Dance: Space Motion Tracking Game
*Project: NASA Space Apps Hackathon 2024*

A space-themed, body-motion game designed for astronauts in microgravity. Using **pose estimation models** like MMPose, it tracks real-time body movement to recreate constellations and dance patterns. Beyond fun, the game promotes mental wellness, physical activity, and connection with Earth.

Built with Python and ReactJS, this system integrates with existing onboard hardware. Earth-based participants can view the performance and interact in real-time.

## ü§ù Let's Connect
I'm always open to new challenges, especially those at the intersection of AI, education, and meaningful impact. Let‚Äôs build something great together.
