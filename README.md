Hello! I’m Juan Carlos Cordón, a passionate explorer of emerging technologies and innovative solutions.

My journey started with an advanced background in Mathematics, grew into a fascination with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and now expands into Quantum Computing and Data Spaces.

I love connecting the dots between disruptive tech trends and real-world challenges, always focusing on creating measurable impact.

I believe in storytelling as a powerful tool to make complex concepts understandable and to spark excitement about new possibilities.

When I’m not coding or researching, you can find me collaborating with diverse teams, organizing knowledge-sharing sessions, or seeking fresh opportunities to harness technology for positive change. For me, innovation isn’t just about cutting-edge models; it’s about shaping a better, more inclusive future through the bold use of ideas.
