Hello! I’m Juan Carlos Cordón.

My journey began with a solid foundation in Mathematics, evolved into a deep fascination with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and is now expanding into Quantum Computing and Data Spaces.

What drives me is connecting the dots between disruptive technologies and real-world challenges, always with a focus on delivering measurable, meaningful impact.

I see storytelling as a powerful way to make complex ideas accessible — and to spark curiosity about the future we can build through innovation.

When I’m not coding or diving into research, I enjoy collaborating with multidisciplinary teams, leading knowledge-sharing sessions, and exploring new ways to apply technology for positive and inclusive change.

For me, innovation isn’t just about cutting-edge models — it’s about using bold ideas to shape a better tomorrow.
